        <h3>    Who we are</h3>
        <pre>
IVY Magazine Club was founded in Fall 2018 
by two FIT students at SUNY Korea. 
The club brings together a diverse group of members 
across IGC to create dynamic editorials, interview 
students and professionals in the fashion industry, 
and capture campus life events. 
       
Our goal is to put out high-quality, interesting, 
and fun content while giving our members 
an opportunity to explore their creative interests 
in fashion, photography, journalism, layout design, 
beauty, social media, and more!

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <pre>
In addition to a full-length magazine with 
Editorial Photoshoots, Special Articles, and Interviews, 
IVY is active on SNS, posting on a blog and Instagram. 

Since 2018, we have done various projects, including 
collaborations with up-and-coming Korean fashion designers, 
Q&As with alumni in the industry, and features covering various 
topics such as Seoul Fashion Week streetstyle. 
            
All of IVYâ€™s content is directed and produced entirely 
by students, under the guidance of our faculty advisors.
