### Problem statement
**I Visualize You (a.k.a IVY)** is an organization founded by students from Fashion Institute of Technology, who aspire to create different high-quality projects which could be shared and displayed to its visitors. <br><br>
**IVY** is currently fractured across multiple platforms(Instagram and magazines), which makes it hard for its administrators to clearly establish **IVY**â€™s identity to its audience. So it needs to consolidate the contents of such platforms into a single web application and provide the users with wholesome information about **IVY** understandably through the web application.  <br><br>
The **initial solution** is to provide the users with a content-management platform, which will not only construct an environment for **IVY** to promote its identity, but also provide the consumers a method to interact with **IVY online**. Further details about the functionalities available to the users as well as variations to the versions of solutions will be discussed as the project continues.
