            IVY Magazine Club was founded in Fall 2018 by two FIT 
            students at SUNY Korea. The club brings together a diverse group 
            of members across IGC to create dynamic editorials, interview students and 
            professionals in the fashion industry, and capture campus life events. 
            </p>
            <p class = 'contents'>
            Our goal is to put out high-quality, interesting, and fun content while giving 
            our members an opportunity to explore their creative interests in fashion, photography, 
            journalism, layout design, beauty, social media, and more!

                In addition to a full-length magazine with 
                Editorial Photoshoots, Special Articles, and Interviews, 
                IVY is active on SNS, posting on a blog and Instagram.

                Since 2018, we have done various projects, including 
                collaborations with up-and-coming Korean fashion designers, 
                Q&As with alumni in the industry, and features covering various 
                topics such as Seoul Fashion Week streetstyle. 
            </p>
            <p class = 'contents'>    
                All of IVYâ€™s content is directed and produced entirely 
                by students, under the guidance of our faculty advisors.
